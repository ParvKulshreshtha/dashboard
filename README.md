**Prerequisites**
Node.js and npm: Ensure you have Node.js (with npm) installed. You can download it from nodejs.org.
Setting Up the Project


**Clone the Repository**: If your project is hosted on a platform like GitHub, clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo


**Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:
npm install
Running the Project


**Start the Development Server**: To run the project locally, start the development server:
npm run dev
This will start the Vite development server. You should see output indicating that the server is running and on which port (usually http://localhost:3000 or http://localhost:5173).
Open the Project in Your Browser: Open your web browser and navigate to the address provided by the Vite development server, such as http://localhost:3000 or http://localhost:5173.


**Common Issues**:
Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed. If you encounter issues, try deleting the node_modules directory and package-lock.json file, then run npm install again.
